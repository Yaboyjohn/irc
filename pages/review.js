              <p>The theme for the Fall 2016 edition is “Changing Landscapes.” Given prominent global events such as the rise of ISIS, environmental degradation, and the shifting demographics of nations around the world, it is imperative to explore and understand these issues in order to more effectively address them. How has the world’s landscape evolved in recent years? What are the implications of these changes? How should the international community approach the issue(s) you discuss?</p>
              <p>Please see below for submission guidelines, and reach out to the Review’s Editor-in-Chief, Aurora Ling, at auroraling@berkeley.edu with any questions or inquiries. All members of the Berkeley community are encouraged to apply, regardless of their affiliation with IRC member organizations. We look forward to reading your entries! </p>
